    <p>As a developr, I'd like to...

        <li>...know how to setup a project's dependencies as a first step of a frontend boilerplate</li>

    <h3>Project Initialization</h3>
    <p>Here, we will leverage npm to initialize a project and install a handful of webpack dependencies. This will not be all dependencies, just enough needed to hopefully get the project started and serving some content.</p>

    <section id="npm init">
      <h4>Setup the project directory</h4>
      <p><b>Create a repo, a folder on your desktop.</b></p>
      <p class="sub">Maybe call it 'frontend-boilerplate'. This will be the folder that will hold the boilerplate.</p>

      <h4>NPM init</h4>
      <p><b>Open a terminal, cd in to the newly created repo.</b></p>
      <p><b><a href="#npm-init">**</a>Run <code>npm init -y</code></b></p>
      <p class="sub">This 'sets up' the repo to leverage npm for the following steps. Now, there will be a package.json file, which acts as the 'config' for npm to know what to do with dependencies, and what files to work with.</p>

      <h4>Install some dependencies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>webpack</li>
        <li>webpack-cli</li>
        <li>webpack-dev-server</li>
        <li>webpack-dev-server</li>
        <li>html-webpack-plugin</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sub">These can be installed using <code>npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin</code>. This 'sets up' the repo to leverage npm for the following steps.</p>
      <p class="sub">Here, webpack dependencies are installed, ready to 'consume' some javascript, reaady to serve in a dev server, and even ready to 'build' into code that is 'ready for production'.</p>
      <p class="sub">Now, the "devDependencies" section of the package.json should look something like...<br>
        <code>
          "devDependencies": {<br>
            &#160&#160"webpack": "^4.44.1",<br>
            &#160&#160"webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",<br>
            &#160&#160"webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"<br>
            &#160&#160"html-webpack-plugin": "^4.4.1"<br>
        }</code>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="npm init">
      <h4>Prepare a start script</h4>
      <p>Here, we will levearge some of webpacks default config settings to serve an index.thml && index.js file in a local development environment. Webpack's <a href="https://v4.webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/" target="_blank">Getting Started Docs</a> are a great place to look into for a quick run-through on setting up a project with webpack.</p>
      <p>Here, a single webpack-dev-server command will exist as a "wds" script. We 'compose' that script into a start script by running or 'calling' the 'wds' script inside the 'start' script.</p>
      <p>Inside the package.json file, inside the "scripts" object, add 2 new key-value pairs. The scripts section of the package.json should showain...</p>
      <code>"scripts": {<br>
      &#160&#160"wds": "webpack-dev-server",<br>
      &#160&#160"start": "npm run wds"<br>
      }</code>

      <h4>TEST IT!</h4>
      <p>Open A terminal if one is not open. cd into the project directory if the terminal is not already. Run...</p>
      <code>npm start</code>
    </section>

    <section id="progress">
      <h4>SEE THE PROGRESS</h4>
      <p>The terminal will output a handful of lines. One of the lines notes... <br>
      <code><code class="blue">ℹ ｢wds｣:</code> Project is running at <code class="blue">http://localhost:your-port-here</code></code><br>
      Navigating to the url in chrome, though, reveals a file directory... not a webpage. <br>
      Lets setup a webpack config file, leverage html-webpack-plugin, and get our index.html page to render from the expected url.
    </section>

  <section id="footnotes">
    <p id="npm-init">** You need Node installed on your machine. I'm assuming Node is already installed on your machine. The <code>-y</code> flag tells npm to skip asking you a few questions.</p>
