    <p>As a developr, I'd like to...

        <li>... leverage webpack-dev-server to serve some html && js for my project.</li>

  <figure id="one-liners">
    <h2 class="header" id="practice-header">The Practice</h2>
    <p>Here, we will levearge some of webpacks default config settings to serve an index.thml && index.js file in a local development environment. Webpack's <a href="https://v4.webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/" target="_blank">Getting Started Docs</a> are a great place to look into for a quick run-through on setting up a project with webpack.</p>

    <section id="npm init">
      <h4>Prepare a start script</h4>
      <p>Here, a single webpack-dev-server command will exist as a "wds" script. We 'compose' that script into a start script by running or 'calling' the 'wds' script inside the 'start' script.</p>
      <p>Inside the package.json file, inside the "scripts" object, add 2 new key-value pairs. The scripts section of the package.json should showain...</p>
      <code>"scripts": {<br>
      &#160&#160"wds": "webpack-dev-server",<br>
      &#160&#160"start": "npm run wds"<br>
      }</code>

      <h4>TEST IT!</h4>
      <p>Open A terminal if one is not open. cd into the project directory if the terminal is not already. Run...</p>
      <code>npm start</code>
    </section>

    <section id="progress">
      <h4>SEE THE PROGRESS</h4>
      <p>The cli will output a handful of lines. an <b>ERROR</b> will be one of them...</p>
      <code class="error">ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in ...</code>
    </section>

    <section id="debug-and-fix">
      <h4>DEBUG AND FIX</h4>
      <h5>Review the Webpack Docs</h5>
      <p>A glance into the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/" target="_blank">webpack configuration docs</a> shows that "...(<i>webpack</i>) will assume the entry point of your project is <code>src/index.js</code>". This means a src folder && a file inside that folder, index.js, need to be present for webpack to work 'out-of-the-box'.</p>
      <h5>Add the expected content</h5>
      <p>Add a <code>src</code> file to the project. Add an <code>index.js</code> file inside the src file. Here, I added a <code>console.log('log from index.js') to test that the log shows in the dev tools.</code></p>
      <h4>TEST IT!</h4>
      <p>Open A terminal if one is not open. cd into the project directory if the terminal is not already. Run...</p>
      <code>npm start</code>
      <p>Here, the project is served at <code>localhost:8080</code>. When I point my browser to that url, I see "listing directory /". Getting webpack to serve content is not completely setup yet. An index.html page needs to be setup, and a webpack.config file needs to be added to include some configuraion details about our project.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="add-html">
      <h4>INCLUDE AN HTML FILE</h4>
      <p>As the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver" target="_blank">webpack-dev-server docs</a> specifically express, "HTML template is required to serve the bundle, usually it is an index.html file". Here we will leverage <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/" taret="_blank">HtmlWebpackPlugin</a> for "... (simplifying) creation of HTML files to serve (our) webpack (bundle)".</p>
      <li>Install html-webpack plugin by using <code>npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin</code></li>

      <li>Leverage <a href="https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#writing-your-own-templates" target="_blank">using our own template</a> by</li>
